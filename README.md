# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Report

Group Andrea, Hallvard, Mikaela

In this project we used the Noroff Api.
Then we made the design for both mobile and desktop. We chose a simple design and focused more on making each component work.
It has been challenging working in a group project, but also useful for learning.
We divided the work into tasks and distributed this among us. We helped each other if one of us got stuck or needed help. We had a few challenges with some of the components, and spent some time fixing the problems that occurred, and making sure everything worked the way it was supposed to.
This time it was easier with the pull requests and the branches, we also went through each other's codes and made a few changes if there were any mistakes or small changes.

In the end the challenges we faced will make us better and we learned how to communicate, coordinate, and help each other.
